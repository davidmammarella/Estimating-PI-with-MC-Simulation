## Estimating Pi with Monte Carlo Simulation

In this python program, I show how to esitmate Pi if you threw n stones randomly at a rectangular wall with a circle inscribed inside of it. By determining which stones land inside
and outside the circle we can esitmate the value of Pi. As the number of stones increase, the accuracy on Pi will increase.
